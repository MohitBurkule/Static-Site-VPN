# Static Site VPN
http://vpn.myexp.epizy.com/

the server on which it runs acts as a vpn  and the site is actually copied  on the server 

#WHY?

During my undergrads my college used to block some of the useull webistes which were from other countries (due to some weird firewall rules )
like thetimes

So I decided to come up with a very simple Static Site VPN and run it on a free web server

HOW?
you simply pass it a website which you want to view , It will copy all the resources of that webpage locally on the server which will be then served
This data will be deleted later depending on total storage available and time
