Access blocked websites effortlessly with Static Site VPN! This innovative solution allows users to bypass firewall restrictions by running a VPN on the server and copying the desired website locally for viewing.

Why Static Site VPN?
During my undergraduate studies, I encountered frustrating firewall rules blocking access to essential websites like thetimes. Determined to overcome these obstacles, I developed Static Site VPN to provide seamless access to valuable online resources.

How Does it Work?
Simply input the URL of the website you wish to access, and Static Site VPN will copy all webpage resources locally on the server. This data is served to users, ensuring smooth browsing without restrictions. Hosted on a free server, this solution is built with PHP, HTML, and JS.
